# Clip

A collection of animated UI components built with Base UI and Motion. Copy, paste, and customize beautiful components with smooth animations for your React projects.

## Motivation

This project is experimental and created for sharing innovative UI component ideas with the community. The goal is to explore creative possibilities with modern animation libraries and provide developers with inspiring examples they can learn from and adapt to their own projects.



## Tech Stack

Built with modern web technologies for optimal performance and developer experience. The project uses **Next.js** as the React framework, **Base UI** for accessible component primitives, **Motion** for smooth animations, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
